## Overview

A 3D single player chess game created with OpenGL. Stockfish was used as the opponent with options to process moves locally or with a public REST API. Sound effects and music were implemented using SFML.

## Requirements
# Preferrably installed at system level:
* __OpenGL__
* __GLFW__
* __GLEW__
* __GLM__
* __AssImp__
* __Curl__
* __JSON__
# Provided in project:
* SFML
* Stockfish
(At large depth settings and especially on limited hardware, Stockfish may take an unreasonable time to process moves. Try setting the processing pipeline to remote if required)

## Setup/Build
